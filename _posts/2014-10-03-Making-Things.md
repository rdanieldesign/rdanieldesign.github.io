Yesterday at TIY was huge in terms of workflow advancement. We setup Yeoman, a project scaffolding tool, on our machines to help accelerate the process of starting a new project. Tim built a custom webapp generator that includes Bourbon and Neat, along with the usual suspects (jQuery, Modernizr, Sass). We also added Gulp to our toolset, which helps to create a test server with livereload for our projects, as well as build out a compressed and minified version for distribution.

I've made two things since we started using JavaScript in our projects. Here's a [calculator](http://rdanieldesign.github.io/jsCalculator), and here's an accordion dropdown [thing](http://rdanieldesign.github.io/Dropdown). I'm super proud of both of them. I know I will look back later and realize how ridiculously simple they are, but for the time being it's a great just to have something up and running. There's no better feeling.
